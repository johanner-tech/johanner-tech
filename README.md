# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Background

I'm an Electronic Engineer from Chile. I've been away from programming for 10+ years:

- I worked developing **embedded systems**. I recon it was a fun (but sadly underpayed) job. I feel I want to play with this, even if it's only as hobby
- Iâ€™m currently working in aviation, more precisely as maintenance engineer of navigational aids


## Why am I here?

I'm evaluating a carrer change, so in the mean time I'm trying to learn the basics of programming **full-stack**
and **data science**. I'm aware of the many differences, but exploring these fields is going to be 2024-2025 for me.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects some day too, if time allows it.

> I'll add some bells and whistles to this README as I progress with coding. Cheers!
